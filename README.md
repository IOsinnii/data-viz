# Data Viz
Repository for sharing some examples of biological data analysis with R using intermediate visualization and statistical modeling techniques.
Currently one quarto report is available following this link: 
https://iosinnii.github.io/intermediate-R/R/01_workflow-biomarker-proteomics.html - this report shares my experience with simple ML methods like PLS-DA, LASSO, Support Vector Machine integrated within proteomics biomarker identification workflow
https://iosinnii.github.io/intermediate-R/R/02_complex-heatmap.html - this report uses pheatmap and ggplot2 methods to create a complex annotated heatmap for literature metanalysis data
## Input folder
Contains 5 different .xlsx tables containing proteomics protein measurments for age groups and microbial species abundance and annotation data. 2 tables for pheatmap method and 2 for ggplot2. 
## Output
figures produced by the script
## R
Quarto reports with the execution code and comments
