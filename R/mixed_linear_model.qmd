## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
install.packages("lme4")
install.packages("broom.mixed")
library(lme4)
library(broom)
library(broom.mixed)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
data("sleepstudy")
head(sleepstudy)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
# Fit the mixed model again
model <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 | Subject), data = sleepstudy)

# Use augment from broom.mixed
fitted_data <- augment(model)


```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Plotting the data with ggplot2
ggplot(sleepstudy, aes(x = Days, y = Reaction, group = Subject)) +
  geom_line(data = fitted_data, aes(y = .fitted), color = "red")  # add fitted model

```
